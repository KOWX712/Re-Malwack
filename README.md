## Features

- Same as [Malwack](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/Malwack/#features) (Porn block, whitelist, reset hosts)
- üö´ Has Blacklist Feature
- üõ†Ô∏è Hosts file is updated daily
- ‚ú® Supports Magisk (v20.0+) KernelSU and Apatch (Apatch is not tested)
- üîß Regularly maintained & updated
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fixed Malwack's bugs 
- üîú More soon....

## Requirements

- Requires [Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) App.
- For KernelSU users and for those who noticed that the hosts file isn't updated after running ``--update-hosts``, install [Overlayfs](https://github.com/HuskyDG/magic_overlayfs) module and it will work.

## Download Module

You can download the module from [Releases](https://github.com/ZG089/Re-Malwack/releases/latest) section.


## Get started

1. Open Magisk, go to Modules section, click on the '+' icon, then select the Re-Malwack Module zip file to install.
2. Reboot your device to activate the Re-Malwack Module's protective features.
3. Enjoy :)

## Command Usage

```
"Usage: re-malwack [--update-hosts | -reset | --blockporn | --whitelist <domain> | --blacklist | --help]"
"--update-hosts: Updates the hosts file"
"--reset: Restore the hosts file to its original state. (Disable ads blocking)"
"--blockporn: Block pornographic websites by adding entries to the hosts file."
"--whitelist <domain>: Remove the specified domain from the hosts file."
"--blacklist <domain>: Adds domain to the hosts file to be blocked
"--help: Display this help message."
```

## Total Blocked
- 905,100+ Malware, Ads, Spyware

## How does it work?

**Where is the file?**
- Your ``hosts`` file located in ``/system/etc``. It "acts" like your school blocking service that blocks you from going to websites. However, this (the ``Hosts`` file) is done locally on your phone's root system. 

**How does the host's file block websites and what modifications were made?**
- How does it block websites: The host file blocks websites and malware by denying access for your phone to connect to it at all. It will just return a blank page. ``0.0.0.0 www.the-website-that-is-blocked.com``.
