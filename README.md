```
"Usage: re-malwack [--restore[-original | -default] | --blockporn | --whitelist <domain> | --help]"
"--restore-default: Restore the hosts file to the modules default state & updates it."
"--restore-original: Restore the hosts file to its original state. (No blocking)"
"--blockporn: Block pornographic websites by adding entries to the hosts file."
"--whitelist <domain>: Remove the specified domain from the hosts file."
"--help: Display this help message."
```

## Total Blocked
- 850,000+ Malware, Ads, Spyware

## How does it work?

**Where is the file?**
- Your ``hosts`` file located in ``/system/etc``. It "acts" like your school blocking service that blocks you from going to websites. However, this (the ``Hosts`` file) is done locally on your phone's root system. 

**How does the host's file block websites and what modifications were made?**
- How does it block websites: The host file blocks websites and malware by denying access for your phone to connect to it at all. It will just return a blank page. ``0.0.0.0 www.the-website-that-is-blocked.com``.

## Get Started

1. **Download & Install**: Open Magisk, go to Modules section, click on the '+' icon, then select the Re-Malwack Module zip file to install.
2. **Reboot**: Reboot your device to activate the Malwack Module's protective features.
3. **Enjoy**: Experience a cleaner, safer digital experience on your rooted device with Re-Malwack!
