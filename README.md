## Command Usage (How to use Re-Malwack on Terminal)

Type``su -c re-malwack`` on Termux to show up the help message which will output this:

```
"Usage: re-malwack [--update-hosts | -reset | --blockporn | --whitelist <domain> | --blacklist | --help]"
"--update-hosts: Updates the hosts file"
"--reset: Restore the hosts file to its original state. (Disable ads blocking)"
"--blockporn: Block pornographic websites by adding entries to the hosts file."
"--whitelist <domain>: Remove the specified domain from the hosts file."
"--blacklist <domain>: Adds domain to the hosts file to be blocked
"--help: Display this help message."
```

> [!TIP]
> ## Total Blocked
> - 907,120+ Malware, Ads, Spyware

## How does it work?
> [!TIP]
> **Where is the file?**
> - Your ``hosts`` file located in ``/system/etc``. It "acts" like your school blocking service that blocks you from going to websites. However, this (the ``Hosts`` file) is done locally on your phone's root system. 

> [!TIP]
> **How does the host's file block websites and what modifications were made?**
> - How does it block websites: The host file blocks websites and malware by denying access for your phone to connect to it at all. It will just return a blank page. ``0.0.0.0 www.the-website-that-is-blocked.com``.

> [!TIP]
> **Does it blocks in-app ads and in-game ads as well ?**
> - Of course it does ! All of this using the magic of magisk and the hosts file !
